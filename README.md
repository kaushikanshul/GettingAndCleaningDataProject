# GettingCleaningData
Course Project for Getting and cleaning data Course in Coursera (May 2015)

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: Version 1.0

The code assumes that all the data is present in the same folder, under a sub-folder called "UCI HAR Dataset", un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analyses described in the assignment.

The output tidy dataset is called Tidy.data.txt.
